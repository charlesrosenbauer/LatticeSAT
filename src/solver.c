/*
	This file is for the path solver, and maybe eventually the lattice solver.
	
	Eventually we might also want a local search system, at least for locating
	high-quality neighborhoods.
	
	A 256-bit local search system might require very different code from an 8,
	12, or 16-bit neighborhood solver. Local search should probably be based
	around a genetic algorithm, with a few thousand generations.
	
	This would be a bit expensive, but we are operating on 256 variables at a
	time and might be able to use neighborhoods as gradients instead of purely
	random mutations.
